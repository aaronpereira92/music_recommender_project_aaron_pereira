# Welcome to the main Notebook made by Aaron Pereira for the GNOD project. In this notebook, I will demonstrate how the **song recommender** works, which is a function that I made in the previous lab. The function already imports all the necessary libraries for it to work. You can check that list of libraries in the _libraries folder, there is a txt file

# If you want to see more information on how the function is made, please have a look at the notebook: **lab_kmeans_clustering.ipynb**

#  

# **VERY IMPORTANT** : You need the config file for your SpotifyAPI credentials login. The function will only work if this file is present. Thanks

# **1.** I'm importing the song_recommender from the **functions.py** file present in the functions folder. 

# In[1]:


from functions import song_recommender


# In[2]:


song_recommender()
